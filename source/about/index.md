My name is Xiangzhen Kong, currently a research staff at the Max Planck Institute, Nijmegen.  I am a brain mapper, and particularly interested in neuroimaging methodologies and brain imaging genetics. My current research is focused on three related areas: 
- Mapping brain asymmetry with multiple imaging modalities and big brain data.
- Exploring genetic basis of brain asymmetry and language network.
- Applications in disorders related to abnormal brain asymmetry.
